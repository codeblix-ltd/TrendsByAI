About the Business

EpicFreelancer.com is a fully-built, digital marketplace that combines the best elements of platforms like Fiverr and Flippa into a single, powerful system. This is a complete business-in-a-box, built on a highly valuable, 7-year-old domain.

The platform is engineered to support 3 distinct, high-demand verticals, allowing you to capture a wide segment of the booming digital economy:

Micro-SaaS & Tools: Entrepreneurs can sell small software solutions and tools.
Professional Services: Freelancers can offer their skills in design, development, marketing, and more.
Digital Products: Sellers can list templates, graphics, software, and other downloadable assets.
This is not a concept or a shell project. It is a feature-complete platform with dedicated dashboards for buyers, sellers, and a powerful admin control panel for you, the owner.

Reason for Selling

Codeblix Ltd specializes in building market-ready software solutions. We have invested significant time and resources to develop EpicFreelancer into the robust platform it is today. With the core development complete, the project is now ready for an entrepreneur who excels at marketing and community building. We are moving to our next project and are looking for the right owner to take this platform and scale it to its full potential. (Trust us, this platform will gain traction very quickly just like the previous we sold, refer to all our previous listings we sold)

Business Model

Primary Revenue: Automatically earn a commission on every single transaction. You can set the commission rate yourself from the admin panel (e.g., 5%, 10%, 15%) without any coding.
Future Revenue Streams: The foundation allows for easy expansion into other revenue models like:
Featured Listings: Charge sellers a premium to have their products or services featured on the homepage.
Subscription Plans: Create monthly/yearly plans for sellers that offer lower fees or advanced tools.
Revenue Potential (Example at 10% Commission)

100 sales/month @ $50 avg → $500/month
500 sales/month @ $75 avg → $3,750/month
1,000 sales/month @ $100 avg → $10,000/month
How to reach these numbers? Start by targeting freelance and creator communities on social media, and use targeted ads for keywords like "freelance marketplace" or "digital product marketplace."

Why This Is a Better Investment

Unlike a content site that requires months of SEO work and constant content creation to see a return, EpicFreelancer.com is a functional platform that provides immediate value. It's a tool that solves a real problem: connecting buyers and sellers in the digital economy. This utility-based model leads to:

Faster Monetization: Revenue is generated from transactions, not just ad clicks.
Higher User Retention: Users return to buy or sell, creating a sticky ecosystem.
Scalable & Predictable Revenue: Commission-based models are proven and scale directly with platform activity.
Included Assets

Premium Domain: epicfreelancer.com (7+ years old, GoDaddy Estimated Value: $1,276).
Complete Source Code: The full frontend and backend codebase
Brand Assets: Logo and any associated design files.
You are receiving a complete, turnkey business, not just an idea.

Financials & Traffic

To validate the platform's core functionality and payment processing system, we recently conducted a limited, soft-launch phase with a small group of beta testers. This was not a full marketing launch but an essential step to prove the business model works. (The current revenue of $32 was generated via the platform's commission-based marketplace model on one-time sales. This model is active and proven.)

Total Transactions (Past 6 Months): 8
Average Transaction Value: $40
Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV): $320
Commission Rate (Set at 10%): $32
Net Revenue (Platform Profit): $32
Ownership Transfer & Support

We will provide 30 days of hands-on technical support to ensure a seamless transition. This includes assistance with deploying the application, configuring the database, and answering any questions about the codebase to get you up and running smoothly.

Summary

EpicFreelancer.com represents a rare opportunity to acquire a fully-built, multi-vendor marketplace on a premium, aged domain.

This is the perfect project for an entrepreneur, marketer, or developer looking to step into a ready-made business in the booming creator and freelance economy without spending months and tens of thousands of dollars on development.
